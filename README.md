# Antibiotic Inhibition Zone Detection

This project automates the detection of antibiotic disks and their inhibition zones in Petri dish images. It measures the sizes of these zones, converts them to real-world units (millimeters), and provides an interactive interface to adjust and view the results. The goal is to simplify and speed up a key task in microbiology: determining how effective antibiotics are at stopping bacterial growth.
